# Independent Gizmo

This is a simple **fabric** mod that decouples the debug gizmo from the debug screen, and map its toggle to a different key (default being (`) grave-accent). It also shows the attack indicator when the gizmo is active.

I have no plans on porting this to **forge**, but the license is MIT, so if someone wants to, they're free to.
